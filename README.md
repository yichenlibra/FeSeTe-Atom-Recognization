# FeSeTe-Atom-Recognization
This repository is devoted to perform clustering on an image with a bimodal distribution (bright or dark). The image is generated by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) on the FeSeTe-Atom. FeSeTe-Atom has an image with a bimodal distribution with bright and dark represents two different atoms. Usually, the ratio between two modes is a useful information to extract from the image.
